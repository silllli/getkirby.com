## Introduction

Static site performance on demand!

This plugin will give you the performance of a static site generator for your regular Kirby installations. Without a huge setup or complex deploy steps, you can just run your Kirby site on any server – cheap shared hosting, VPS, you name it – and switch on the static cache to get incredible speed on demand.

With custom ignore rules, you can even mix static and dynamic content. Keep some pages static while others are still served live by Kirby.

The static cache will automatically be flushed whenever content gets updated in the Panel. It's truly the best of both worlds.

Rough benchmark comparison for our starterkit home page:

Without page cache: ~70 ms
With page cache: ~30 ms
With static cache: ~10 ms

This plugin is still an experiment. The first results are very promising but it needs to be tested on more servers.

## Cache configuration

Staticache is just a cache driver that can be activated for the page cache:

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type' => 'static'
    ]
  ]
];
```

You can also use the cache ignore rules to skip pages that should not be cached:
https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/cache#caching-pages

```php
// /site/config/config.php

return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type' => 'static',
      'ignore' => function ($page) {
        return $page->template()->name() === 'blog';
      }
    ]
  ]
];
```

Kirby will automatically purge the cache when changes are made in the Panel.

## htaccess rules

Add the following lines to your Kirby htaccess file, directly after the RewriteBase rule.

```
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/static/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html -f [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*) %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/static/%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html [L]
```

## nginx

Standard php nginx config will have this location block for all requests

```
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```
change it to add `/static/$uri/index.html` before last `/index.php` fallback

```
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /static/$uri/index.html /index.php?$query_string;
}
```
